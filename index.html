    <h1>Hello I'm Luis Alvarez</h1>
    <h2>Remote web developer</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m a self-taught junior full-stack web developer with a passion for building web applications that solve
      real problems. I love turning ideas into working apps, whether it’s a clean frontend interface or a secure backend
      API.
    
      I have hands-on experience with JavaScript (ES6+), React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, and I enjoy learning
      by creating real projects—from small task management apps to full-stack SaaS-style MVPs.
    
      I’m eager to join a team where I can contribute, learn from experienced developers, and continue growing as a
      full-stack developer. I’m especially interested in remote opportunities where I can make an impact while learning
      every day.
